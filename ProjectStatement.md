Project Title:
PDF-to-XML Converter Web Application

Project Overview:
Develop a fast, scalable web application that converts PDF files to XML while preserving 
document structure and formatting. The application must include secure user authentication, file upload functionality, 
a robust PDF-to-XML conversion engine, and comprehensive conversion history management. The project will be built incrementally 
in levels to ensure each feature is well-tested and to allow early deployment on Vercel for build verification and debugging reduction.

Technical Stack:
	•	Frontend: Next.js
	•	Backend: NestJS
	•	File Upload: Uploadthing (or an equivalent fast service)
	•	Database: Cloud-based (Neon - PostgreSQL with Prisma for SQL or MongoDB Atlas for NoSQL)
	•	CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn components
	•	Authentication: Clerk (providing out-of-the-box email/password authentication)
	•	Error Detection: Sentry
	•	Deployment: Vercel (starting from the initial scaffold to catch build issues early)
	•	Additional Integrations (Post-Level 4):
	•	Testing: Jest (for unit and integration tests)
	•	Analytics: Posthog
	•	Caching & Rate Limiting: Upstash (using Redis or similar)

Coding Best Practices & Project Management:
	•	Modularity:
	•	Write clean, modular code by separating concerns (authentication, file handling, conversion logic, UI components).
	•	Documentation:
	•	Comment code thoroughly and maintain a detailed README.md outlining setup instructions, technology choices, and testing procedures.
	•	create in start only a level wise todo_checklist.md that lists every feature with checkboxes, updated as each is completed.
	•	Version Control:
	•	Use Git with clear commit messages after each major accomplishment and update the checklist.md accordingly.
	•	Testing:
	•	Prioritize automated tests for all components to catch issues early and minimize debugging.
	•	For Error Detection: Setup and Use Sentry from the start to catch errors in production.
	•	Continuous Deployment:
	•	Use Vercel from the initial stages to continuously deploy and catch build issues early.
	•	Security:
	•	Ensure strict authentication/authorization, input sanitization, rate limiting, and proper file validations.
	•	For frontend:
	• 	Finalize your global.css with color and spacing variables
	• 	Define your tailwind.config.js with consistent theme tokens
	• 	Stick to one design language (Material, iOS, custom, etc.), Keep components atomic and reusable
	•	You need to avoid Redundant classes,Inline styles,Conflicting breakpoints, Broken responsiveness

Important Note on Database & API Design:
Instead of prescribing a specific database schema and API structure upfront, you should analyze the requirements at 
each development stage and propose appropriate database models and API endpoints as the project evolves. This adaptive approach 
allows you to design the most efficient and appropriate architecture based on the emerging needs of the application. For each level, propose:
• The necessary database models/schema
• Required API endpoints
• Data validation requirements
• Any relationships between data entities

PDF Processing & XML Generation Strategy:
	•	PDF Processing:
	•	Frontend: Utilize PDF.js for client-side PDF rendering and basic text extraction.
	•	Backend: Use pdf-parse or pdf-lib for more complex PDF processing, especially when advanced parsing (tables, lists, styling) is needed.
	•	Consider a hybrid approach for very complex PDFs by leveraging both client and server-side libraries.
	•	XML Generation:
	•	Define a clear XML schema to preserve document hierarchy (e.g., document → section → paragraph → text/formatting).
	•	Use JS libraries like xml2js or fast-xml-parser to help with XML generation or rely on custom mapping functions with DOM manipulation/template literals.
	•	Implement XML validation against the defined schema to ensure output integrity.

Data Flow Architecture:
	1.	Upload:
	•	User uploads a PDF via the Next.js frontend (using Uploadthing) → File metadata and file stored in the cloud database/storage.
	2.	Processing:
	•	The backend (NestJS) retrieves the file, processes it using PDF libraries (pdf-parse/pdf-lib), and generates XML based on the defined schema.
	3.	Display:
	•	The converted XML is sent back to the frontend, where it is displayed with options for copying, downloading, and viewing conversion history.
	4.	History & Management:
	•	Conversion history and user-specific documents are managed via secured API endpoints, ensuring data isolation per user.

Project Levels & Functionalities:
	1.	Level 1 – Basic Implementation:
	•	Authentication:
	•	Implement a simple login/registration system using Clerk.
	•	File Upload:
	•	Enable users to upload PDF files via Uploadthing.
	•	User Abstraction and Accessibility:
	•	Users must only see their own uploaded documents and conversions
	•	Conversion Engine (Basic):
	•	Develop a basic PDF-to-XML conversion that extracts text content from PDFs.
	•	Output Display:
	•	Show the converted XML on-screen with options to copy or download.
	•	Conversion History:
	•	Display a list of previous conversions (user-specific) and store them in the cloud database.
	•	Deployment & Version Control:
	•	Deploy the initial scaffold on Vercel to catch build issues early.
	•	Commit changes after each major milestone using clear, descriptive messages.
	•	Maintain a checklist.md to tick off every individual feature as implemented.

	2.	Level 2 – Intermediate Implementation:
	•	Enhanced Authentication:
	•	Continue using Clerk for secure user sessions and prepare for potential JWT integration or similar if needed.
	•	Improved Conversion Engine:
	•	Enhance the PDF-to-XML conversion to preserve basic structure such as paragraphs and headers.
	•	UI Enhancements:

State Management & Performance Considerations:
	•	State Management:
	•	Use React Query for managing server state (data fetching, caching, and synchronization).
	•	Implement Zustand or React Context for managing UI state.
	•	Performance Optimization:
	•	Implement chunked processing for PDFs larger than 10MB.
	•	Use web workers on the frontend to handle heavy PDF processing tasks without blocking the UI.
	•	Implement server-side pagination for the conversion history to maintain responsiveness.
	•	Security Measures:
	•	Apply input sanitization for all user inputs.
	•	Implement rate limiting and robust file validation to prevent abuse.
	•	Ensure that all API endpoints enforce strict authentication and authorization.
	•	Also deletion of conversion or file etc. can be done using server actions of next js. 
	•	We can have pdf viewing maybe with parallel routes. I think if needed , we can also use dynamic routes, decide accordingly.

API & Error Handling Specifics:
	•	API Design Principles:
	•	Follow RESTful API design for clear, maintainable endpoints.
	•	Provide comprehensive error messages for endpoints that handle file uploads, conversions, and profile updates.
	•	Error Handling Strategies:
	•	Catch and log errors for PDF parsing and XML generation.
	•	Validate XML against the defined schema and return meaningful error messages on failure.
	•	Handle network interruptions during file uploads/downloads gracefully.
	•	Monitor database connection errors and implement fallback mechanisms.
